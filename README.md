# improve-unity-standard-asset-camera

Based on Unity Standard Assets (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/32351)

## What I've improved
* Make all private serialized variables to public, easily to access that variables by codes
* FreeLookCam can zoom in/out by scrolling mouse
* More will coming later :p
